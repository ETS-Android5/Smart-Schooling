# Overview
Almost everything getting upgraded in this modern world but still school students carry a big backpack which contains lots of books and notes to their school everyday, because of that they are facing many health issues.

So to over come these issues we proposed a system where students will carry a single android tablet to school instead of carrying many books and notes.

This application can make students day to day life a lot easier.
