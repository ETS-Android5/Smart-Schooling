# Smart-Schooling
An android application to make students life easier by reducing their backpack weight.

# Overview
Almost everything getting upgraded in this modern world but still school students carry a big backpack which contains lots of books and notes to their school everyday, because of that they are facing many health issues.

So to over come these issues we proposed a system where students will carry a single android tablet to school instead of carrying many books and notes.

This application can make students day to day life a lot easier.

## Setting up the project
Install `git` if you do not already have it installed from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

Once installed, open a terminal and run the following command to clone the repository into the current directory. You may be asked to enter your username/password. If so, just enter your GitHub username and password.

`git clone https://github.com/ThamizhKaniyan/Smart-Schooling.git`

This will create a new directory named `Smart-Schooling`. To import the project into Android Studio, open Android Studio then hit `File` > `Open` then choose the new directory that was created.
